# Event Booker

![](https://github.com/javenkn/event-booking/raw/master/images/application-home.png)

## Purpose

To create an application using React, MongoDB and GraphQL. I wanted to learn more about GraphQL under the hood without using Apollo. Followed [Academind](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJbGtTlrDami-tDGPUV9-w)'s tutorials to gain a better understanding of the different technologies used throughout this project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
